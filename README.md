- 👋 Hi, I’m @hridaimehta
- 👀 I'm a Computer Science Honours student at the University of Manitoba with a passion for software development and problem-solving. My technical skills include Java, C/C++, C#, assembly, SQL, and various databases (SQLite, HSQLDB, Neo4j, MSSQL, and MongoDB). I'm experienced with Agile methodologies, unit testing, and version control (GIT). Currently, I'm honing my skills in Android mobile app development using Java and web development tools (CSS, JS, and HTML).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Database and software designing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects related to databases or object oriented programming
- 📫 You can reach me on my discord @asteroid#0940
